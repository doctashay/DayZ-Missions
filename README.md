# DayZ Legacy Mission Data
A collection of mission files for DayZ Legacy 0.44. 

Scripts in this repository make references to `modules_Dayz.pbo`and `server_data.pbo` which are both script modules. These contain scripted gameplay data for almost every type of player interaction with the game world. The "redirected" version of these script modules lives in my DayZ-Legacy-Addons repository. 

dayz_Auto.ChernarusPlus contains the current working version of the DayZ Legacy mission.
